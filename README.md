Simple example of using Gzdoom actors as fully 3D moving platform.
For someone who dont know, Doom ports family cant move sectors like Build engine.

It have two console variables.
First one is move_platform. Its a bool value. It control should platform moves or no.
Second is platform_speed. Its an integer value. It control platform speed. Since for now its example handle platform moving only along X axis, it only control speed along it.
